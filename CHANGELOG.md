|---|---|

| ## [0.3.0] — 2025-07-04 — Polish Release |

### Added
- **Orbitron font** — Google Fonts CDN link for the futuristic arcade lettering throughout the UI.
- **Sound-toggle button** — 🔊/🔇 circular button (top-right of the game container) to mute/unmute SFX.
- **Keyboard sound toggle** — press `M` while playing to toggle sound on/off.
- **Keyboard restart from Game Over** — press `Space` or `Enter` on the Game Over screen to restart immediately without clicking.

### Changed
- **UI font-family** updated from `Arial, sans-serif` → `'Orbitron', Arial, sans-serif` for a sci-fi arcade aesthetic.
- **Pause screen** replaced the old inline-style overlay with a proper `.screen` class-based overlay (matches title/win/game-over styling and includes a RESUME button).
- **Flash rendering** simplified — removes the separate `flashOverlay` canvas and `flashCtx` context. Flash effects now render directly on the main `canvas` via `ctx.setTransform()` / `ctx.fillRect()`, removing an entire off-screen canvas from the render path.
- **Canvas resize handling** — new `fitCanvas()` function constrains the game canvas to `min(window.innerWidth - 40, 800)` px; called on window resize and each `startGame()`.
- **Input routing** — Space/Enter gameover restart handler placed *before* the jump logic in `keydown`, so gameover always takes priority.

### Removed
- Deleted the orphan `<canvas id="flashOverlay">` HTML element and its `#flashOverlay` CSS block (flash is now drawn on the main canvas).
